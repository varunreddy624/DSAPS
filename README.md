**Merge sort**



* Implement heap sort or merge sort first so that temporary files can be sorted directly
* It might be better to divide the file according to number of values and not by bytes
* 4500 numbers 
    * 1000
    * 1000
    * 1000
    * 500
* Use overloaded getline to split string according to comma
* Inbuilt functions are not allowed
    * Use custom sort to sort numbers in temporary array
    * Later use merge process
    * In place merge sort 
    * K way merge sort
        * Consider all k arrays at once, use heaps to get minimum of all available elements
* Use ifstreams
